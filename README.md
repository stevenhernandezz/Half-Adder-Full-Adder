# Half-Adder-Full-Adder
 This project focuses on using gate level coding method to construct a Half Adder, and a Full Adder.
 
## Description 
 This project includes a gate level Half Adder, and Full Adder. The Half Adder has two inputs (A and B) which are being passed through an XOR and AND gate and two outputs (S and C). The Full Adder is composed of two Half Adders and an OR gate. Its purpose is to perform addition or subtraction and generate a carry and sum. It has 3 inputs (A, B, and Cin) which A and B are being passed into two half adders while Cin takes the output of the carry of both half adders and puts it through an OR gate. It has two outputs which are sum and carry.
